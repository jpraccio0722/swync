 * The tutorial, in reading order.

 * Unlike the reference, none of this is generated: the tutorial is prose
 * somebody wrote, and its order is an argument about what to learn first. This
 * table is that order, and the only place it is written down — the sidebar, the
 * index, and the prev/next links at the foot of a page all read it, so adding a
 * chapter is a page under `src/pages/tutorial/` and one entry here.
