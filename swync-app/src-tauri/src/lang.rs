//! The language's callable surface, as data.
//!
//! Names, arities and parameter names used to live in three places at once: the
//! match arm in `lowerer::call`, the arity literals in `lowerer::lists`, and —
//! for parameters — nowhere except the error strings in `swync_graph::realizer`.
//! The editor needs all of it, so it lives here instead, and the lowerer reads
//! it rather than repeating it. Adding a UGen to `UGENS` is now the only step
//! needed to make it callable *and* completable.
//!
//! Parameter names for the pure audio-rate UGens follow fundsp's own `Input N:`
//! documentation; the ones baked in at construction follow the names already
//! used in the realizer's error messages.
//!
//! The `doc` strings are the one part of this file that is not decided here.
//! They are a copy of the body of the matching page under
//! `website/src/content/docs/`, flattened to a line, because the app's docs
//! panel and the site are two renderings of one reference and a reader who has
//! read one has read the other. The prose is written on the page and copied
//! back; a name added here seeds its page from whatever is written below
//! (`website/scripts/sync-reference.mjs`), and after that the page is the
//! source and this is the copy.
