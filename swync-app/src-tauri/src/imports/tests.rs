//! Imports, mostly against a filesystem made of a map.
//!
//! Every test here is a little project: one file being run, and the files it
//! reaches for. The checks are on the program that comes out — a flat list of
//! definitions with no `use` left in it — and, where it matters, on what that
//! program lowers to, since a name that resolves to nothing is only visible
//! once something tries to play it.
//!
//! The tests about the drawn patterns use a real folder rather than the map,
//! because that is their claim: a project's patterns are a file in it.
