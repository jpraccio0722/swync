//! Rewriting the names in one file so they can live beside every other file's.
//!
//! Expansion produces a single flat program, so two modules that both define
//! `kick` have to end up with two different names in it. Every definition a
//! module makes is filed under `<module>::<name>`, and every mention of it —
//! wherever it was written, and however it was written — is rewritten to that.
//!
//! The whole difficulty is knowing what is a mention. A parameter called `kick`
//! is not the imported `kick`, and neither is a `let` that shadows it, so this
//! walk carries the same scope stack the lowerer will: names bound by a `fn`'s
//! parameters, a `let`, a block's statements, or a `for` are left alone inside
//! the body they cover.
