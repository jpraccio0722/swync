//! Sending a pattern out as MIDI.
//!
//! This is the scheduler's third route to making something happen, and the
//! only one that leaves the machine. The graph is continuous and lives in the
//! engine's slot; a pattern bound to an instrument becomes a `fundsp` voice
//! pushed into the `Sequencer`; a pattern bound to a [`Destination`] becomes
//! two bytes on a wire at a moment in time. What makes the third one its own
//! thread is that the first two are *rendered* — they are handed to the audio
//! callback with a start time and it places them to the sample — while a MIDI
//! message is only ever sent *now*. Nothing downstream will place it for us,
//! so something here has to wait until the moment and then send.
//!
//! ## Why a thread of its own, at a millisecond
//!
//! The scheduler thread wakes every 25 ms, which is right for its job: it
//! works a fifth of a second ahead and hands the sequencer absolute times, so
//! when it wakes has nothing to do with when anything sounds. Sending MIDI on
//! that tick would make when it wakes the only thing that matters, and 25 ms
//! of jitter on a snare is not tight playing — it is audibly loose, and worse
//! than a hardware sequencer from 1983.
//!
//! So the notes are still *decided* on the scheduler's pass, a fifth of a
//! second early, and handed here as messages with the audio time they are due
//! at. This thread does nothing but wait for those times. At a 1 ms tick the
//! error is a millisecond and it is jitter rather than drift, which is the
//! part that matters: a snare a consistent millisecond late is a snare on the
//! beat.
//!
//! ## Audio time is not wall time, and this thread needs wall time
//!
//! Everything in the engine is stamped in *audio time* — frames rendered,
//! divided by the rate ([`Clock::now_secs`]). That number is the right one to
//! schedule against, because it is what the sequencer places voices on, and
//! MIDI that agrees with the audio is the whole point. But it does not
//! advance smoothly: the audio callback adds a whole buffer at a time, so
//! reading it in a loop gives a staircase whose step is the buffer — 10 ms on
//! a 512-frame device. Waiting on it directly would quantize every message to
//! that staircase and throw away most of what the 1 ms tick bought.
//!
//! So the thread keeps an **anchor**: one pairing of an audio time with an
//! `Instant`, from which the audio time *now* is predicted by ordinary
//! elapsed wall time. Between callbacks the prediction moves smoothly, which
//! the staircase does not, and the two are reconciled slowly rather than at
//! once — see [`CORRECTION`]. A sound card's clock really does run at a
//! slightly different rate from the system's, so an anchor left alone drifts;
//! one snapped to every reading inherits the staircase it was built to avoid.
//!
//! Two things reset it outright rather than correcting: a disagreement larger
//! than [`RESYNC_SECS`], which is a device switch or a stall rather than
//! drift, and having no anchor at all.
//!
//! ## The offset is not a fudge factor
//!
//! Audio time counts frames *rendered*, and a rendered frame has not been
//! heard yet — it is still in the device's buffers, and then in a converter,
//! and the gear at the other end of the MIDI cable has its own delay before
//! it makes a sound. None of that is knowable from here, and all of it is
//! specific to the desk. [`Out::set_offset`] is where a person puts the answer
//! once they have heard it, and it is in the settings file rather than the
//! project's for the reason the audio devices are: it describes the room, not
//! the piece.
