//! Every call a program writes, wherever it is written.
//!
//! A syntax walk rather than a lowering pass, and the difference is the whole
//! reason this exists: **an instrument's body is not lowered until the
//! scheduler builds a voice from it**, one note at a time, on a thread with a
//! deadline. Anything that has to be settled before the music starts —
//! decoding a file, giving a slider a slot and telling the panel about it —
//! cannot wait for that. So it is read off the text instead, where a `fn`
//! nobody has played yet is as visible as a line at the top of the file.
//!
//! Two callers want the same walk for that same reason: [`crate::samples`],
//! which asks which files a program names, and [`crate::controls`], which asks
//! which sliders it declares. They shared nothing but a bug risk while the
//! walk was written twice — see the note on [`walk`] about exhaustiveness,
//! which is only worth anything if there is one copy of it to be exhaustive.
