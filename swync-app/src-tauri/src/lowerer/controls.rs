//! `slider(name, lo = 0, hi = 1, start = lo)` — a control in the panel, named
//! where it is used.
//!
//! Intercepted before its arguments are evaluated, for the reason `load` and
//! `midiout` are: the name is a string, and a string is not a value in this
//! language. `Expr::Str` is refused everywhere else precisely so that text
//! cannot be carried around and mistaken for something that sounds, so the
//! names that take one read it off the syntax instead.
//!
//! The other half of what happens here is that **nothing is decided here**.
//! The shape of a slider — its range, where it starts, which slot it has — is
//! settled by [`crate::controls::declare_in`] walking the program's syntax
//! before lowering begins, because an instrument's body is not lowered until a
//! note plays and the panel cannot wait for one. So this looks the name up and
//! agrees with what is already on the panel, and only falls back to declaring
//! one itself where no pass has run at all, which is a test lowering a program
//! directly.
//!
//! That is also what makes "the first declaration wins" true of the *sound*
//! and not merely of the warning: a second `slider("cutoff", 0, 1)` written
//! with a different range lowers to the range the first one asked for, because
//! what it reads is the table rather than its own arguments.
