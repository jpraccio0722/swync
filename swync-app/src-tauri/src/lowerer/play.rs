//! `play(pattern, instrument, rate = 1, <lane>: pattern, ...)` — binding a
//! pattern to an instrument.
//!
//! `play` is intercepted before argument evaluation because the instrument
//! must be named syntactically: `Binding` stores a name, and a `Value::Function`
//! has already lost it. Having the definition in hand is also what lets a lane
//! name be checked against the instrument's parameters here, at eval time,
//! rather than failing once per event on the scheduler thread.
//!
//! `play_once` and `playn` are the same binding with an end to it: they differ
//! only in the `bars` the binding carries, which is where the whole of "stop
//! after n passes" lives.
//!
//! `play_all` writes no binding of its own. It is the parallel counterpart to
//! `.then`: several plays that all open together, gathered into the one handle
//! that `.then` can chain from.
