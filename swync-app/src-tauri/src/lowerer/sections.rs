//! Arrangement: the family of combinators that chain from a `play`.
//!
//! `.then` is the root of it, and the rest are variations on the one move it
//! makes — lower a section now, at eval time, with `play_start` moved to
//! wherever it should begin. Nothing here is a callback, and the audio thread
//! learns nothing new: it still sees bindings that happen to open later.
//!
//! **A section is an argument that is not evaluated on the way in.** That is
//! the whole reason `call` hands this module raw `Arg`s the way it hands `play`
//! its instrument: a `play` writes its notes at whatever `play_start` says when
//! it runs, so evaluating `.then(playn(...))` before `.then` has moved
//! `play_start` would put those notes at the origin and leave nothing to place.
//! Lowering the argument inside `at_offset` instead is what makes
//! `.then(chorus)` and `.then(playn(...))` the same thing by the same
//! mechanism, rather than two spellings with two implementations. See `place`.
//!
//! The same sentence says why a play *bound to a name* is not a section:
//! `let a = playn(...)` already ran, and already sounds where it was written.
//! The name is a handle for chaining *from* — `a.then(b)` — and never a section
//! to be placed. `place` refuses it rather than lowering nothing.
//!
//! Not every combinator can take a section written out, and the line is drawn
//! by whether it needs to run the section *again*. `then_n` re-lowers its
//! argument once per pass, so it can. `then_each`, `wthen`, `rthen`,
//! `shuffle_then` and `maybe` cannot: their sections arrive inside a list, or
//! are chosen between after the fact, and either way the arm has to be
//! something still runnable when the choice is made. Those keep taking a `fn`,
//! and `function` says so when handed anything else.
//!
//! Three of them break the placing rule, and it is worth knowing which.
//!
//! `.take` and `.stop` reach *backwards*, shortening bindings that are already
//! on the timeline. They are the only things in the language that edit a
//! binding after it was written, which is what lets a bounded pattern decide
//! when an unbounded one gives up.
//!
//! `wthen` (with `rthen` and `maybe`) is the one that genuinely needs the
//! scheduler's help. Everything else settles at eval time; a choice that
//! rerolls cannot, because there is nothing at eval time to reroll *against*.
//! So it writes every arm's bindings, marks them as belonging to one choice,
//! and lets `Patterns::windows` decide which arm sounds each time around. See
//! [`ChoiceGroup`] for why that decision is a hash and not an RNG.
