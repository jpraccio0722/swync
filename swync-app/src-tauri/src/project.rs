//! What a project remembers between sessions.
//!
//! A project is a folder, and until now that was the whole of it: a tree in the
//! panel and a `patterns.swync` beside the files. But some of what you set while
//! working belongs to the piece rather than to the app — the tempo it is played
//! at, how loud it sits, what it is called — and all of it was lost the moment
//! the window closed.
//!
//! This is the file that keeps it: a `swync-project.json` in the project folder,
//! read when the project opens and written as any of it changes. JSON rather
//! than swync, because none of it is a program: the project's other file,
//! `patterns.swync`, is folded into every run, and settings must never be.
//!
//! Nothing here is required. A folder with no such file is still a project —
//! that is every folder until it is opened once — and reading one says so
//! rather than failing, so the transport is left exactly where the performer
//! put it. A file that is *there* but unreadable is a different matter, and is
//! reported: the next thing the editor would do is write over it.
