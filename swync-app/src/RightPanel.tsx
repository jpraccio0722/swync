 * The right-hand panel: the program's own controls, the drawn patterns, the

 *
 * They share a panel because all of them are things you reach for *while*
 * writing a program, and all of them want to be reachable without giving up
 * the file you are looking at. They are not all the same kind of thing —
 * settings belong to the app, the reference to the language, and the patterns
 * and the sliders to the piece — but that difference is one the tray's icons
 * carry, and it is not a reason to make either of the last two cost a window.
 *
 * Like the left panel, its tray of icons is pinned to the window's edge and
 * outlives the panel, and every view stays mounted with the hidden ones only
 * taken off screen: the reference keeps its search and its scroll position
 * while the patterns are showing, and the settings keep the folder they have
 * already read.
