/**
 * The swync tokenizer, mirroring `src-tauri/src/parser/lex.rs`.
 *
 * A stream tokenizer rather than a Lezer grammar: swync's lexical structure is
 * flat enough that a generated parser would buy nothing but a build step.
 *
 * The one rule worth stating explicitly — **swync's only string is the path in
 * `load("...")`, and it has no escape sequences**. The JavaScript mode this
 * replaces treated the backtick rest token as the start of a template literal,
 * which swallowed the remainder of the file, and would read a backslash trigger
 * as escaping the next character. Both are ordinary one-character tokens here,
 * and a string runs to the next `"` or the end of the line — never past it.
 *
 * **This file imports nothing**, and describes its two inputs and its stream
 * structurally rather than by the types `metadata.ts` and CodeMirror give them.
 * That is what lets the tutorial site run this tokenizer over its code blocks
 * at build time: the editor's colours and the website's are one tokenizer, and
 * a website that has no editor in it pays for none of CodeMirror or Tauri to
 * say so. What is CodeMirror's about highlighting — the tag table, the theme,
 * the language — is in `language.ts`, which wraps what is here.
